I'm a cross-platform mobile developer and teacher from Ukraine 🇺🇦

A few facts about me:
- 📱 I started developing mobile apps in the previous millennium (in 1989) on a soviet calculator MK-61. You can read an [article about my experience](https://dev.ua/blogs/posts/khokhlov-1695328040) (on Ukraine) or try [the MK-61 simulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cax.pmk.ext) on your Android-device
- 🐈 Here is a list of some my pet-projects: [XbaSoft](https://xvadim.github.io/xbasoft/)
- 🎲 I like to play verious intellectual games (Jeopardy, What?When?Where?) as well as unusual board games (Mancala, Seega, Ur)
